Workshop format
---------------

The workshop is planned as an open-space event in which the workshop
participants host and participate in discussions related to the topics of
interest.

At least one author of each paper is expected to register for the workshop.
During the workshop, the author is expected to host or co-host a discussion
group. We plan to align the topics of the discussion groups with the topics
of the authors submissions. The hosts will take minutes which are to be
aggregated into a report after the workshop. We wish to encourage authors
to offer their help in the report writing process to the organizing committee.

### Workshop registration fee waiver giveaway 

We have **one free registration for the workshop** to give away. Want to have it? Give us a good reason why you need and deserve it by briefly answering the following questions:

* Why is interoperability important to you?
* Why are you important to interoperability?

We give preference to a **student** who is short on money and would otherwise not be able to attend the workshop. 

Please send your application or any questions regarding the process by mail to **eckart AT ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de** until **March 16, 2016**. 

**NOTE**

* **We cannot cover any travel costs or accommodation -- only the registration fee for the INTEROP 2016 workshop itself can be waived.** 
* **To be able to use the free registration, you must not yet have registered/paid for the INTEROP2016 workshop or for any other workshop on May 23rd 2016.** To the best of our knowledge, the free registration can be added to any already existing registration that does not cover May 23rd 2016 (e.g. a registration for the main conference).
* The final decision on the award of the waiver will be taken at the sole discretion of the INTEROP2016 organisers and on the basis of the identified criteria. The organisers reserve the right to verify the eligibility of all applicants. The decision of the organisers shall be considered final and not appellable. Due to organisational constraint we are not able to offer any feedback on the decision process. By applying for a waiver applicants agree to the above conditions. INTEROP2016 and LREC2016 organisers cannot be held liable on any legal basis in connection to the fee waiver issuance.

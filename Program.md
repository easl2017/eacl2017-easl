<b>Interoperability - Can a model driven approach help to overcome organizational constraints?</b><br/>Alessandro di Bari

<p><br/>Alessandro Di Bari is an IBM Executive/Senior Certified application architect.
He developed great experience in the application development field from both development process and application architecture point of view.
Starting from a deep involvement with modeling languages, he achieved significant results in the Model Driven Development (MDD) space, developing Domain Specific Languages for industries such as insurance. 
Since 2011, he works in the NLP/cognitive field, successfully applies his MDD skills in this field and also published several papers on this topic.
Since 2014, he works for the IBM Watson Cognitive Healthcare in the T.J. Watson research center in New York, USA.</p>

### eInfrastructures: crossing boundaries, discovering common work, achieving common goals

Embedded in the INTEROP 2016 workshop, the *eInfrastructures* workshop is a sub-event realized as one of breakout groups of the main workshop.

*Moderators: Stelios Piperidis (Athena Research Centre), Hege van Dijke (LIBER Europe)*

The quantity and variety of digital research data of all types, the increasing number of solutions for mining such data to discover new knowledge, the variety of requirements of users of such data min-ing tools and services pose new challenges to the numerous infrastructural initiatives. When it comes to language data and processing, we experience multiple efforts towards generic or domain specific platforms for data aggregation and delivery, tools and services discovery, workflows or-chestration and execution. Common questions in these efforts consist in interoperability at different levels: metadata of language resources and annotations, data representations and vocabularies, ser-vices across platforms and frameworks, cloud computing infrastructures, access restrictions and permissions for certain operations. In this session, we bring together strategic players in order to discuss parallel efforts being undertaken and opportunities for long-term harmonisation and stra-tegic collaboration among existing (and future) e-Infrastructures in Europe, and the world at large, with a focus on, inter alia:

- What are the necessary strategies to enable crossing the boundaries of platforms, scientific domains, languages, national legislations?
- What can we learn from similar attempts so far?
- What can the research community do to promote these goals?
- What sort of alliances and policies are necessary to support overcoming the current barriers?

Submission
----------

We invite submissions of extended abstracts/short papers describing recent
work, thoughts, or best practices on one or more of the topics of interest (up
to 4 pages). All submissions will be reviewed using a simple blind process by
at least three programm committee members and will be assessed based on their
relevance, potential to create constructive discussion, and clarity of
writing. The submissions must be formatted in compliance with the style sheet
that will be adopted for the LREC Proceedings (to be announced later on the
Conference web site).

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop in the form of a 5 minute
lightning talk and included in the workshop proceedings. If there is an
unexpectedly high number of submissions, we may consider accepting some as
posters.
